Tic Tac Heaven Factor Control is a latch-disjunctively factorable game of Tic Tac Heaven. There is a latch move that both players can make at the beginning of the game. If a player elects to make the latch move, the factorization of the games will occur. If a player does not play the factorization move at the beginning, then for the remainder of the game, he will be unable to play at any (x, y) location on the small board if he had previously played on the (x, y) sub-board of the Nine Board game.
